Powerlifting Workout Plan Generator (Alpha Version)

This is an early version of an application that generates personalized powerlifting training plans based on a user questionnaire. By selecting weak points in your lifts and choosing your preferred training system, the app creates a structured workout program tailored to your needs.

Key Features:
Select weak points for the squat, bench press, and deadlift.

Choose from 3 training systems:
3-day SBD (Squat, Bench, Deadlift),
3-day FBW (Full Body Workout),
4-day Upper/Lower split.

This Alpha version is a work in progress, and future updates will bring improvements and new features to enhance the user experience and functionality.
